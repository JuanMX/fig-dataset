# Data set: Fig plant segmentation from aerial images

Aerial image data set for use in plant segmentation research. Images were gathered by a RGB camera mounted on a quadcopter flying low over a crop of figs (Ficus carica). Images reflect an open field fig crop on a sunny day with a really complicated background. The data set includes a hand-made ground truth segmentation with pixel precision to facilitate the comparison among different algorithms of the research community.
