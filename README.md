# fig-dataset


We present an aerial image data set for use in plant segmentation research, where images were gathered by a camera mounted on a quadcopter flying low over a crop of figs (Ficus carica). Images reflect an open field fig crop on a sunny day with a really complicated background. The data set includes a hand-made ground truth segmentation with pixel precision to facilitate the comparison among different algorithms of the research community.  Likewise, we present a Convolutional Neural Network with an encoder-decoder architecture trained end-to-end as the means to address the problem of plant segmentation at the granularity of pixel. Our approach achieves a mean accuracy of 93.85% despite the complexity of the background and a highly variable visual appearance of the leaves.
